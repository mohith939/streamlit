# Approach, Assumptions, and Edge Case Handling

This document outlines the approach, assumptions, and edge case handling strategies used in the Documentation Structure Extractor.

## Approach

The Documentation Structure Extractor uses a combination of web crawling, HTML parsing, and content analysis to identify the structure of documentation websites. The approach is based on the following principles:

### 1. Recursive Crawling

The tool uses a breadth-first search algorithm to crawl the website up to a specified depth. It starts with the provided URL and follows links within the same domain to discover additional pages. The crawler is designed to be efficient and respectful of the website's resources, using connection pooling and content size limits to improve performance.

### 2. HTML Parsing

The tool uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML content and extract meaningful information. It focuses on the content area of the page, ignoring navigation, headers, footers, and other non-content elements. The parser is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different HTML structures.

### 3. Module Detection

The tool uses multiple techniques to identify modules in the documentation:

- **Heading-based**: Identifies modules based on heading tags (h1, h2, h3)
- **Section-based**: Identifies modules based on section tags with class attributes
- **List-based**: Identifies modules based on list items with strong emphasis
- **Table-based**: Identifies modules based on table rows with header cells

The parser prioritizes heading-based detection but falls back to other techniques if headings are not found or do not provide sufficient information.

### 4. Submodule Detection

The tool uses multiple techniques to identify submodules within modules:

- **Table-based**: Extracts submodules from tables related to a module
- **Definition List-based**: Extracts submodules from definition lists
- **Section-based**: Extracts submodules from sections with submodule-like names
- **List-based**: Extracts submodules from lists within module sections
- **Code Block-based**: Extracts submodules from code blocks with function/method declarations

The parser uses an aggressive submodule detection approach that combines these techniques to find as many submodules as possible.

### 5. Content Cleaning

The tool cleans and normalizes the extracted content to ensure consistency and readability:

- Removes HTML tags and attributes
- Normalizes whitespace and line breaks
- Truncates long descriptions to a reasonable length
- Removes duplicate or redundant information

### 6. JSON Formatting

The tool formats the extracted data as JSON with proper indentation and structure. It supports both standard JSON and a custom format that matches the required output format.

## Assumptions

The tool makes the following assumptions about documentation websites:

### 1. Structure Assumptions

- Documentation websites have a hierarchical structure with modules and submodules
- Modules are typically represented by headings or distinct sections
- Submodules are typically represented by sub-headings, lists, or tables
- Module descriptions are typically found near the module heading
- Submodule descriptions are typically found near the submodule name

### 2. Content Assumptions

- The documentation is primarily text-based with HTML markup
- The content is accessible without JavaScript rendering
- The content is organized in a logical and consistent manner
- The content is in a language that uses Latin script (English, Spanish, etc.)

### 3. Technical Assumptions

- The website is accessible via HTTP/HTTPS
- The website allows automated access (no CAPTCHA or other anti-bot measures)
- The website has a reasonable size and complexity
- The website uses standard HTML elements and attributes

## Edge Case Handling

The tool includes strategies for handling various edge cases:

### 1. Website Access Issues

- **Rate Limiting**: Implements connection pooling and request delays to avoid rate limiting
- **Blocked Access**: Includes special case handling for sites that block automated access
- **Redirects**: Follows redirects to handle URL canonicalization
- **Malformed URLs**: Normalizes and validates URLs before processing
- **Timeouts**: Sets reasonable timeouts for HTTP requests to avoid hanging

### 2. Content Parsing Issues

- **Complex Layouts**: Uses multiple detection techniques to handle different layouts
- **Missing Descriptions**: Provides default descriptions when none are found
- **Duplicate Modules**: Merges duplicate modules based on name similarity
- **JavaScript Content**: Only processes the initial HTML, not JavaScript-rendered content
- **Malformed HTML**: Uses robust parsing to handle malformed HTML

### 3. Special Cases

- **Instagram Help**: Includes special handling for Instagram help pages, which block automated access
- **API Documentation**: Uses specific techniques for API documentation pages
- **GitHub Pages**: Handles GitHub Pages documentation with specific techniques
- **Single-Page Applications**: Attempts to extract content from single-page applications

### 4. Output Formatting Issues

- **Empty Data**: Handles empty data gracefully
- **Special Characters**: Properly escapes special characters in JSON
- **Large Output**: Handles large output efficiently
- **Invalid JSON**: Ensures the output is valid JSON that can be parsed by standard JSON parsers

## Limitations

Despite the robust approach and edge case handling, the tool has some limitations:

- **JavaScript-heavy sites**: The tool may not work well with sites that rely heavily on JavaScript to render content, as it only processes the initial HTML.

- **Complex layouts**: Some documentation sites with non-standard or highly complex layouts may not be parsed correctly.

- **Rate limiting**: Some websites may block or rate-limit automated access, which can affect the tool's ability to crawl the site.

- **Deep hierarchies**: The tool is designed to extract a two-level hierarchy (modules and submodules). More complex hierarchies may be flattened or simplified.

- **Language limitations**: The tool is primarily designed for English-language documentation. It may not work as well with documentation in other languages, especially those that use non-Latin scripts.

- **Content behind authentication**: The tool cannot access content that requires authentication or is behind a paywall.

## Future Improvements

Based on the current approach and limitations, the following improvements could be made in the future:

- **JavaScript Support**: Add support for JavaScript-rendered content using a headless browser
- **More Detection Techniques**: Implement additional techniques for module and submodule detection
- **Language Support**: Improve support for non-English documentation
- **Authentication Support**: Add support for accessing content behind authentication
- **Caching**: Implement caching to avoid reprocessing the same URLs
- **Custom Parsers**: Add support for custom parsers for specific websites
